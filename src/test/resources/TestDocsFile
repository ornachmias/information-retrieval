THE CONGO THE U.N . DRIVES IMPLACABLY AHEAD BELGIAN

CEMENT WORKER ALBERT VERBRUGGHE WAS DRIVING HIS WIFE AND ANOTHER WOMAN

DOWN A QUIET STREET IN THE COPPER TOWN OF JADOTVILLE ONE DAY LAST WEEK,

WHEN HE SUDDENLY HEARD THE CLATTER OF GUNFIRE . PULLING THE TRIGGERS

FOR NO APPARENT REASON WERE NERVOUS INDIAN TROOPS OF THE ADVANCING

UNITED NATIONS FORCE . VERBRUGGHE SLAMMED HIS LITTLE VOLKSWAGEN TO A

HALT . HIS WIFE WAS ALREADY DEAD, THE OTHER WOMAN DYING . WITH AN

ANGUISHED SCREAM, VERBRUGGHE STUMBLED OUT, BLOOD STREAMING FROM A WOUND

UNDER HIS EYE . " MY WIFE IS KILLED, " HE CRIED . " WHY, WHY, WHY ? "

THE SAME QUESTION, IN A LARGER CONTEXT, WAS BEING ASKED IN MANY

CAPITALS LAST WEEK . FOR THE THIRD TIME IN 15 MONTHS, THE WORLD WAS

HORRIFIED WITNESS TO THE SPECTACLE OF FOREIGN SOLDIERS, AIDED BY THE

U.S., SEIZING THE TOWNS AND FIRING ON NATIVE SOLDIERS OF THE CONGO . TO

MANY, THE U.N.'S VERY PRESENCE IN THE AFRICAN LAND WAS OF DOUBTFUL

WISDOM . BUT IN ANY CASE, THE BLAZING GUNS AND SWOOPING PLANES OF THE

U.N . HARDLY FITTED THE PACIFYING INTENT OF ITS ORIGINAL CONGO MANDATE

. " IT IS AN UNSPEAKABLE TRAGEDY, " SAID CONNECTICUT'S DEMOCRATIC

SENATOR THOMAS DODD, " THAT THE WORLD ORGANIZATION WHICH WAS SET UP TO

PREVENT WAR AND PRESERVE THE PEACE SHOULD BE STARTING WARS . " IN

LONDON, 90 TORY M.P.S ACCUSED THE U.N . OF ACTING " CONTRARY TO ITS OWN

CHARTER . " EVEN PRESIDENT KENNEDY, WHO LAST WEEK ORDERED THE U.S . TO

BEGIN SHIPPING 2F-TON TRUCKS, ARMORED CARS AND TRANSPORT PLANES TO THE

U.N . CONGO FORCE, WAS REPORTED TO BE ALARMED AT THE DISORDER THAT

AROSE FROM THE U.N . SHOOTING . ON TO JADOTVILLE . BUT THERE WAS NO

TURNING BACK ON THE BASIC DECISION THAT HAD BEEN MADE . KATANGA'S

SECESSIONIST PRESIDENT MOISE TSHOMBE HAD USED EVERY SLY TRICK IN THE

BOOK TO FRUSTRATE EFFORTS TO REUNITE HIS REBELLIOUS,

COPPERRICH PROVINCE WITH THE REST OF THE CONGO . NOW, U.N .

SECRETARY-GENERAL U THANT, WITH U.S . ENCOURAGEMENT, WAS DETERMINED TO

END THE KATANGA PROBLEM ONCE AND FOR ALL . THE OCCASION HAPPENED TO BE

THE COLLAPSE OF DISCIPLINE AMONG TSHOMBE'S BOOZY, RAGTAG 20,000-MAN

GENDARMERIE . WHEN THEY BEGAN SHOOTING AT U.N . SOLDIERS IN KATANGA A

FORTNIGHT AGO, THE U.N . REPLIED WITH ALL THE POWER AT ITS COMMAND .

LAST WEEK IRISH INFANTRYMEN MARCHED INTO KIPUSHI, SITE OF COPPER MINES

AT THE RHODESIAN BORDER . ETHIOPIAN U.N TROOPS ALREADY OCCUPIED

ELISABETHVILLE ITSELF . BUT THE BIG PRIZE WAS JADOTVILLE, A TOWN OF

90,000, WHERE THE GIANT UNION MINIERE MINERAL

OUTFIT PRODUCES ONE-THIRD OF ITS COPPER (110,000 TONS) AND

THREE-FOURTHS OF ITS COBALT (6,600 TONS) EACH YEAR . TOWARD JADOTVILLE,

70 MILES FROM ELISABETHVILLE, MOVED A TWO-MILE-LONG COLUMN OF INDIANS

COMMANDED BY BRIGADIER REGINALD NORONHA, A GUTTY SOLDIER WHO MUNCHED

HARDBOILED EGGS WHILE MORTAR SHELLS BURST AROUND HIM . WEAPONS AFLOAT .

ALARMED AT THE PROSPECT OF DAMAGE TO MINE INSTALLATIONS IN WHICH BOTH

BRITAIN AND BELGIUM HAD HEAVY INVESTMENTS, BRITISH U.N . AMBASSADOR SIR

PATRICK DEAN AND BELGIUM'S WALTER LORIDAN DEMANDED ASSURANCES FROM

THANT THAT THE U.N . FORCES WOULD GO NO FARTHER . THANT ASSURED THEM

THAT THEY HAD HALTED AT THE LUFIRA RIVER . THAT WAS CORRECT, UP TO A

POINT . WITH THREE BRIDGES DOWN, THE INDIANS STOPPED AT THE LUFIRA ALL

RIGHT, BUT ONLY LONG ENOUGH TO RIG ROPES AND PULLEYS TO A SWIMMING

FLOAT AND FERRY 120-MM . MORTARS, RECOILLESS RIFLES AND JEEPS ACROSS

THE STREAM . NORONHA HAD NO ORDERS TO TAKE JADOTVILLE BUT THEN AGAIN,

HE HAD NO ORDERS NOT TO SO HE KEPT ON GOING . UNOPPOSED, THE INDIANS

TROOPED INTO JADOTVILLE WITH NORONHA HIMSELF HEADING

A COLUMN OF JEEPS . THINGS WERE GOING LESS SMOOTHLY BACK AT U.N .

HEADQUARTERS IN MANHATTAN . CONVINCED THAT THANT HAD DECEIVED THEM

ABOUT JADOTVILLE, BELGIAN AND BRITISH DIPLOMATS WANTED TO KNOW WHAT HAD

HAPPENED . THANT INTIMATED THAT HIS AIDES IN THE CONGO HAD EXCEEDED

THEIR ORDERS . " THERE OCCURRED A SERIOUS BREAKDOWN, " A SPOKESMAN

SAID, " IN EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION AND COORDINATION BETWEEN THE U.N .

HEADQUARTERS AND THE LEOPOLDVILLE OFFICE . " OFF TO LEOPOLDVILLE " TO

DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THIS LAPSE AND TO ENSURE IT WILL NOT RECUR "

FLEW U.N . UNDER SECRETARY RALPH BUNCHE . BUT ONCE THERE, BUNCHE

ANNOUNCED THAT THE U.N . STILL WANTED " FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT "

THROUGHOUT ALL OF KATANGA, AND ADDED : " THE TASK

RUSSIA THAT STRANGE TIME I AM NOT RETREATING ONE DAMNED STEP .

IT IS GOOD TO BE ANGRY AT UNTRUTH . SO, IN THE FULL FLUSH OF

DESTALINIZATION, WROTE EVGENY EVTUSHENKO, 29, THE RUSSIAN POET WHOSE

HONEST RAGE AT THE CANT AND CALLOUSNESS OF SOVIET SOCIETY HAS MADE HIM

THE IDOL OF HIS GENERATION . FOR A WHILE, IN FACT, IT SEEMED AS IF

EVTUSHENKO (TIME COVER, APRIL 13, 1962) HAD BECOME A SEMIOFFICIAL ANGRY

YOUNG MARXIST, WHOSE OCCASIONAL EXCESSES WERE TOLERATED BY THE REGIME

BECAUSE THEY MADE IT APPEAR AS IF KHRUSHCHEV'S COMMUNISM COULD ACTUALLY

ACCEPT CRITICISM . IF SO, EVTUSHENKO PUSHED HIS LUCK TOO FAR . VAIN

APOLOGIES . DURING A SWING THROUGH FRANCE AND WEST GERMANY EARLY THIS

YEAR, THE DASHING YOUNG POET WAS LIONIZED AT PARTIES (INCLUDING A

MASQUERADE BALL DURING MUNICH'S ANNUAL CARNIVAL) BY PLEASURE-LOVING

BOURGEOIS INTELLECTUALS . HE EVEN HELD A SERIES OF FREEWHEELING PRESS

CONFERENCES . HEAPING SCORN ON THE PARTY FOSSILS WHOSE HACKWORK WINS

THE STALIN PRIZE EACH YEAR, EVTUSHENKO ACTUALLY BLAMED STALIN'S REIGN

OF TERROR ON THE DICTATOR'S " CLOSE ASSOCIATES " OF WHOM, THOUGH HE DID

NOT SAY SO, NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV IS THE DEAN EMERITUS . THE POET'S MOST

AUDACIOUS GESTURE OF INDEPENDENCE WAS TO GIVE THE EDITORS OF FRANCE'S

L'EXPRESS HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY FOR PUBLICATION, KNOWING WELL THAT NO

SOVIET WRITER IS PERMITTED TO PUBLISH ABROAD WITHOUT FIRST GETTING

CLEARANCE FROM THE CENSORS . CUED BY KHRUSHCHEV HIMSELF, WHO RECENTLY

RAPPED EVTUSHENKO FOR " CHEAP SENSATIONALISM, " A THREE-DAY MEETING OF

THE UNION OF SOVIET WRITERS LAST MONTH ADDRESSED ITSELF ALMOST

EXCLUSIVELY TO DESTROYING THE CULT OF EVTUSHENKO . IN ALL, CLOSE TO 40

TAME AUTHORS TROOPED MONOTONOUSLY FORWARD TO DENOUNCE EVTUSHENKO AND

OTHER LIBERAL YOUNG WRITERS FOR OFFENSES RANGING FROM BAD RHYMES TO "

SACRILGEIOUS STATEMENTS " ABOUT THE REVOLUTION . THOUGH EVTUSHENKO MADE

ABJECT APOLOGIES FOR HIS " IRREVOCABLE MISTAKE, " THE DRUMFIRE OF

CRITICISM ONLY GREW LOUDER AND MORE INSISTENT . MUTTER IN MINSK . LAST

WEEK THE SOVIET PRESS FUMED THAT EVTUSHENKO AND OTHER YOUNG WRITERS

SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO TRAVEL ABROAD UNTIL THEY " MATURE POLITICALLY

. " WHEN A WEST GERMAN GIRL WAS DETAINED AT THE SOVIET BORDER ON

CHARGES OF SMUGGLING CAVIAR, IZVESTIA BROUGHT EVTUSHENKO INTO IT BY

CHARGING THAT SHE HAD MET EVTUSHENKO IN GERMANY AND FROM HIM HAD

LEARNED ALL ABOUT " FASHIONABLE MOSCOW YOUTH . " IN MINSK, WHERE DMITRY

SHOSTAKOVICH'S NEW 13TH SYMPHONY WAS PERFORMED FOR THE FIRST TIME

OUTSIDE MOSCOW, A CRITIC CASTIGATED THE COMPOSER FOR BASING PART OF HIS

SCORE ON EVTUSHENKO'S FAMED POEM, BABI YAR, A SAVAGE INDICTMENT OF

SOVIET ANTI-SEMITISM THAT THE LITERARY COMMISSARS HAVE ALREADY MADE

EVTUSHENKO REVISE . THOUGH KHRUSHCHEV WAS PLAINLY OUT TO MAKE

EVTUSHENKO THE SCAPEGOAT, THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE POET WAS ONLY PART

OF A NEW, SYSTEMATIC ATTEMPT TO CLAMP STRICT PARTY CONTROLS ON THE

THEATER, MUSIC, ART, BOOK PUBLISHING, INDUSTRIAL DESIGN, AND EVERY

OTHER FIELD IN WHICH YOUNG COMMUNISTS MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO VOICE

INDEPENDENT THOUGHTS . IT WAS ONCE MORE THAT " STRANGE TIME, " AS

EVTUSHENKO WROTE IN 1960, " WHEN COMMON INTEGRITY COULD BE CALLED

COURAGE . /
